(Fermat's Last Theorem Approximations &amp; Riemann-Zeta Zeroes)


# Overview
1. Fermat near-misses.

Fermat "near-misses" approximates the solution of x^n + y^n ~= z^n for all integers, with 0<x<=y<z<2^n in a given interval of n.
Extended from z<10^6 to z<2^23 = 8388608 with a threshold of the absolute value r = nz^n-3/(z^n - y^n - x^n) at 1.

Heuristic suggests that for all n anf r0, the number of solutions of |r|<r0 with z<N, should be asymptotically propotional to CnLog(N)/r0 where Cn is the area of Ln "circle" |x|^n + |y|^n < 1 and r<<z^0(1) holds for all n>3.

This is random though in some cases systematic families of solutions exceed random expectations.
